<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Michael Kuhn, I am 22 years old and was born on the 7th of June 2001. I have 3 brothers and 2 sisters
  from whom 1 brother and 1 sister are "step" and the other 1 brother and 1 sister are siblings from different mothers.
  I only have younger brother from the same mother.
</p>

<p>I live in South Africa, Western Cape (bottom of the map). I first lived in PE (Port Elizabeth) when I was a toddler
  and then moved back and forth during my Mother and Father's divorce. Long story short, my mother is now married to my
  step father whom also happens to be her "cousin"...we eventually moved to Oudtshoorn and this is where I currently 
  live and also where I attended both primary and highschool.
</p>

<p>I am a very open minded person, also a christian. I like to play alot of videogames in my spare time and that is kinda
  the reason why I got into coding and technology. My dream is to one day become a full fletched game developer. I am trying
  to keep this summary to a minimum, if you have any other questions that you would like to know about me..then feel free to
  contact me.
